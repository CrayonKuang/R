# A study of the incidence rate of respiratory cancers among Atomic Bomb survivors in Japan.

In August 1945, the United States dropped 2 atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
exposing hundreds of thousands of people to high levels of radiation.
The immediate effects were devastating, with an estimated 110,000 people killed instantly (Wellerstein, 2020).
However, the long-term health effects of radiation exposure are still being studied today.

Smoking and radiation exposure are both known risk factors for respiratory cancers, 
but the extent to which these exposures interact to increase risk is not fully understood. 
Our study will help to fill this gap in knowledge by investigating the independent and joint effects of smoking and radiation on respiratory cancer risk among Japanese atomic bomb survivors in Nagasaki. We address the following important questions:
1. What are the independent and joint effects of smoking and radiation on the incidence rate of respiratory cancers?
2. What are the most significant risk factors for respiratory cancers, including smoking, radiation, and other relevant factors?
3. Can these risk factors be used to predict the incidence rate of respiratory cancers?
